= RedmineLocalAvatars

This plugin allows Redmine users to upload a picture to be used as
an avatar (instead of depending on images from Gravatar).

Users can set their image through the /my/account page.  The administrator
can also manage users' avatars through the /users section.

== Installation

Simply place the plugin in the vendors/plugins directory of your Redmine
installation (or create a symlink).

== Compatibility

Tested on Redmine trunk r4388	(version 1.0.3).  Should be compatible with
all Redmine versions 1.0.x.

At the moment the plugin doesn't work when running in development mode.

Forked this source code to add polish translation and easyup redmine plugin installation for my admin (bzr is not as popular as git :D)

== Warranty.  What warranty?

This plugin was written for use in an intranet with simple requirements in 
mind.  In particular, not much attention has been payed to security issues 
and there hasn't been any thorough testing.  Use it at your own risk.  
Patches are welcome.


== Implementation Notes

Avatar images are treated as attachments to User objects 
with the description 'avatar'.  The AccountController is patched
to provide the images, and the UsersController and MyController are
patched to provide mechanisms to add/delete avatars.
